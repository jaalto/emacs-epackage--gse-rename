Description: enhance rect.el by adding numering rectangles
    Provides `gse-rename' which shows two columns of filenames.
    The first column is the SOURCE filenames, the second column is the
    DESTINATION. Command C-c C-c (gse-rename-go) will rename all of
    the source filenames to their respective target names.
    .
    This makes it easy to rename files with clever text-editor
    maneuvers like rectangle operations, replace-string, etc.
    .
    Note 2010-12-03 the code was last updated 2004.
